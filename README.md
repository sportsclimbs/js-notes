## How to Learn Anything Fast by Josh ?
1. Takes about 20 hours or 40 mins per day of *focused* study for 1 month
2. Break it down into component sub-skills
3. Read/ Skim 3-5 books etc. on the subject to see what are the most important things to learn
4. Remove any/all distractions so you can give your undivided attention to the practice.
5. Make it easy for yourself to practice
6. Pre commit to at least 20 hours of focused practice before you begin.
   1. The early hours of practice are frustrating for everyone. Pre commitment means you'll push past the difficult early period.

There are three stages to Learning

1. Hard difficult
2. Can start to do it without thinking
3. Automatic

## Some Markdown notes
1. You can add links at the bottom of a page to keep them out the way (like this page)
    Write the text out as normal in square brackets then put a number (or any text string) in a second set of brackets:
    
    `[Awesome website to see][1]`

    Then at the bottom of the page or whereever you want, you put the full link preceded by:
    1. The number in square brackets
    2. a colon
    3. and a space

    Thus: `[1]: http://www.awesome-website.com/` 
2. When adding code blocks you can just intent the code and it should appear as a block.
   
   However using 3 backticks and the beginning and end AND writing the language immediately after the first set of backticks will help parsing the code and add syntax highlighting.
   ```css
    body {
     font-size: 30px;
     color: red; 
   }
   ```
3. To make tables:
   1.  separate the headings with pipes
   2.  Add a blank row showing ` |:------|:------|`
   3.  With the colons on the L the text will be left aligned. To centre the text add a colon on each side or R side for R aligning.
4.  You can make checkboxes in markdown. Like a list and one on top of another:
    1.  [ ] frogs
    2.  [x] toads
    3.  [ ] snakes
    4.  [ ] lizards
   
    To create on just use square brackets with a space in between. To tick on use and `X` instead of a space.
